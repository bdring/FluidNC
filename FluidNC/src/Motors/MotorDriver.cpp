    TODO
        Make sure public/private/protected is cleaned up.
        Only a few Unipolar axes have been setup in init()
        Get rid of Z_SERVO, just reply on Z_SERVO_PIN
        Class is ready to deal with non SPI pins, but they have not been needed yet.
            It would be nice in the config message though
    Testing
        Done (success)
            3 Axis (3 Standard Steppers)
            MPCNC (dual-motor axis with shared direction pin)
            TMC2130 Pen Laser (trinamics, stallguard tuning)
            Unipolar
        TODO
            4 Axis SPI (Daisy Chain, dual-motor axis with unique direction pins)
