    // Pin extenders...
    //
    // The PCA9539 is identical to the PCA9555 in terms of API. It provides 2 address
    // pins, so a maximum of 4 possible values. Per PCA, there are 16 I/O ports in 2
    // separate registers, so that's a total of 16*4 = 64 values.
    // Datasheet: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pca9539.pdf
    // Speed: 400 kHz
    //
    // The PCA8574 is quite similar as well, but only has 8 bits per device, so a single
    // register. It has 3 address pins, so 8 possible values. 8*8=64 bits.
    // Datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCA8574_PCA8574A.pdf
    // Speed: 400 kHz
    //
    // An optional 'interrupt' line can be used. When the 'interrupt' is called, it means
    // that *some* pin has changed state. We don't know which one that was obviously.
    // However, we can then query the individual pins (thereby resetting them) and throwing
    // the results as individual ISR's.
    //
    // NOTE: The data sheet explains that interrupts can be chained. If that is the case, the
    // interrupt will have the effect that ALL PCA's in the chain have to be queried. Needless
    // to say, this is usually a bad idea, because things like endstops become much slower
    // as a result. For now, I just felt like not supporting it.
    //
    // The MCP23017 has two interrupt lines, one for register A and register B. Apart from
    // that it appears to be quite similar as well. It has 3 address lines and 16 I/O ports,
    // so that's a total of 8 * 16 = 128 I/O ports.
    // Datasheet: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/20001952c.pdf
    // Speed: 100 kHz, 400 kHz, 1.7 MHz.
    //
    // MCP23S17 is similar to MCP23017 but works using SPI instead of I2C (10 MHz). MCP23S08
    // seems to be the same, but 8-bit.
    //
    // MAX7301 is SPI based, and like all the others, it can generate an ISR when the state
    // changes (pin 31). Address is selected like any other SPI device by CS. MAX7301 includes
    // pullups and schmitt triggers.
    // Datasheet: https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/1804140032_Maxim-Integrated-MAX7301AAX-_C143583.pdf
    //
    // How this class works...
    //
    // A single device has a bunch of pins, normally 8 or 16. These devices also have an address.
    // The maximum number of extender I/O pins that we currently support is currently 64. Note that
    // the I2C frequency doesn't really matter if you have the ISR handled. We limit the maximum number
    // of ports to 64 here, which basically means you *can* wire multiple devices on a single ISR line
    // by making good use of the addresses.
    //
    // Keep in mind that low latency is only possible if you do things correctly with placement on the
    // PCB, and with designating I/O ports for very specific purposes. If not, the firmware won't know
    // what an interrupt means, and has to figure it out before it can take action.
    //
    // A typical configuration looks like:
    //
    //   device: pca9539
    //   device_id: 0
    //   interrupt: gpio.36
    //
