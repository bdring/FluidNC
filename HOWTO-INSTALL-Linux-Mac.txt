** FluidNC installation instructions for Linux and MacOS

1. Download the file InstallFluidNC.sh from the release assets.

2. Start a shell (terminal) window on your computer

3. Determine the version and build type that you wish to run.
   - The version is something like  v3.0.5
   - The build type is one of  wifi , bt , wifibt , or noradio

4. Run the following shell command substituting your chosen version and type:

    ./InstallFluidNC.sh -version v3.0.5 -type wifi

  It will fetch the release archive for that version and type, unzip it, fetch
  and unzip the "esptool" program, and run that program to install FluidNC on
  your ESP32 - which must be plugged in to a USB port.

5. On Linux, if the program complains that it cannot access the serial port, you might be
   able to fix it by running this command:

     sudo adduser $USER dialout

   where $USER is the user name that you use to login.

6. On MacOS, you might be able to fix serial port problems by following these instructions:
