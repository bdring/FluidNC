// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.

// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed when ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So,
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and the system begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.

// Writing to non-volatile storage (NVS) can take a long time and interfere with timely instruction
// execution, causing problems for the stepper ISRs and serial comm ISRs and subsequent loss of
// stepper position and serial data. This configuration option forces the planner buffer to completely
// empty whenever the NVS is written, to prevent any chance of lost steps.
// It doesn't prevent loss of serial Rx data, especially if a GUI is premptively filling up the
// serial Rx buffer.  GUIs should detect GCodes that write to NVS - notably G10,G28.1,G30.1 -
// and wait for an 'ok' before sending more data.
// NOTE: Most setting changes - $ commands - are blocked when a job is running. Coordinate setting
// GCode commands (G10,G28/30.1) are not blocked, since they are part of an active streaming job.

// In old versions of Grbl, v0.9 and prior, there is a bug where the `WPos:` work position reported
// may not correlate to what is executing, because `WPos:` is based on the GCode parser state, which
// can be several motions behind. This option forces the planner buffer to empty, sync, and stop
// motion whenever there is a command that alters the work coordinate offsets `G10,G43.1,G92,G54-59`.
// This is the simplest way to ensure `WPos:` is always correct. Fortunately, it's exceedingly rare
// that any of these commands are used need continuous motions through them.

// By default, feed rate overrides are disabled for all G38.x probe cycle commands. Although this
// may be different than some pro-class machine control, it's arguable that it should be this way.

// keeping probing cycles to their programmed feed rates, the probe sensor should be a lot more
// repeatable. If needed, you can disable this behavior by uncommenting the define below.
