      Please search for answers on the [wiki](http://wiki.fluidnc.com) first.
      If you don't find an answer, read [this](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/support/requesting_help) to help you fill in the forms below.  The better the information you provide, the better we can help you. Information that you might think is irrelevant is often the key to solving the problem.  **If we have to keep asking for information that you should have provided at the outset, we will become annoyed fairly quickly.**  The amount of information that we ask for might seem excessive; it is not.  We handle several issues a day.  We cannot solve problems efficiently if we have to keep going back and forth for the basic information that we need.

      Tell us which controller board you are using, for example 6-pack, MKS DLC32, XPro V5, etc.
      If it listed at https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC/wiki/Hardware-that-Runs-FluidNC , just give
      the name and version.  If it is not, **provide a photo** and documentation.  If it a custom
      board of your own design, you need to give us **a lot** of information.  Do not expect us to
      guess.

      If your problem is in any way related to input pins, limits, or homing, please supply
      schematics and photos for the corresponding circuits.  You can supply a link to a schematic for
      a third party board, a hand-drawn schematic, or anything that will let us understand
      the circuits.  If you are using one of Bart's modular boards, also indicate which
      input module you are using.  We need to know what is on both ends of the circuit - the
      switch end, the controller end, and everything in between.

      Paste the startup messages here.  You can see them by sending "$ss" from FluidTerm, WebUI Console, or any sender's console.
      Look through the messages for any MSG:ERR or MSG:WARN lines.  They indicate problems in your config file.  You might be able
      to solve the problem yourself.  **Do not excerpt just the messages you think are revelant.
      We need to see everything.**  [More info about startup messages](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/support/requesting_help#fluidnc-startup-messages)
