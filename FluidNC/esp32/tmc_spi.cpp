// There is no .h file to define the interface to this code.
// It works by replacing weak methods in the TMCStepper library,
// namely TMCStepper::read() and TMCStepper::write()

// It uses low-level direct access to the SPI hardware instead of
// trying to use the ESP-IDF spi_master() driver.  The reason for this
// is because the SD Card driver, which uses the same SPI bus but
// with a different CS pin, requires DMA mode, but DMA mode does not
// work properly for TMC devices that have a 5-byte input packet length;
// The last few bytes get stuck somewhere and do not make it into the
// input buffer.  I tried to switch back and forth between DMA mode
// and non-DMA mode, but that turned out to be extraordinarily difficult
// since the mode is applied at the very top level of SPI bus driver setup.
// In order to switch modes, it was necessary to completely tear down
// the various levels of the SD-on-SPI driver, reinit everything, then
// restore the old setup in all of its levels.  That proved too difficult.
// So instead I went directly to the SPI hardware via the "spi_ll_"
// interface, which is basically direct access to the hardware registers
// wrapped up to look like function calls (implemented as inlines, so
// the compiler generates very compact code).  There are two downsides
// to this method, neither of which really matter in our situation.
// The first is that there is no locking to prevent this code from
// interfering with SD card access that is already in progress.  That
// is not a problem because TMC device access and SD Card access never
// happen simultaneously.  The second is that the code polls for completion
// without letting other tasks run.  That is not a problem because TMC
// register access was effectively a blocking operation anyway, so it
// doesn't matter whether it blocks at a low or high level of abstraction.
// The time for a register access is less than 70 us for an I2SO CS pin
// and about half that for a GPIO CS.

// This code assumes that the SPI bus has already been initialized,
// with SCK, MOSI, and MISO pins assigned, via SPIBus.cpp
