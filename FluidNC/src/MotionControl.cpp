                      sin(phi)  cos(phi] * r ;

           For arc generation, the center of the circle is the axis of rotation and the radius vector is
           defined from the circle center to the initial position. Each line segment is formed by successive
           vector rotations. Single precision values can accumulate error greater than tool precision in rare
           cases. So, exact arc path correction is implemented. This approach avoids the problem of too many very
           expensive trig operations [sin(),cos(),tan()] which can take 100-200 usec each to compute.

           Small angle approximation may be used to reduce computation overhead further. A third-order approximation
           (second order sin() has too much error) holds for most, if not, all CNC applications. Note that this
           approximation will begin to accumulate a numerical drift error when theta_per_segment is greater than
           ~0.25 rad(14 deg) AND the approximation is successively used without correction several dozen times. This
           scenario is extremely unlikely, since segment lengths and theta_per_segment are automatically generated
           and scaled by the arc tolerance setting. Only a very large arc tolerance setting, unrealistic for CNC
           applications, would cause this numerical drift error. However, it is best to set N_ARC_CORRECTION from a
           low of ~4 to a high of ~20 or so to avoid trig operations while keeping arc generation accurate.

           This approximation also allows mc_arc to immediately insert a line segment into the planner
           without the initial overhead of computing cos() or sin(). By the time the arc needs to be applied
           a correction, the planner should have caught up to the lag caused by the initial mc_arc overhead.
           This is important when there are successive arc motions.
