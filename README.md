## Introduction

**FluidNC** is a CNC firmware optimized for the ESP32 controller. It is the next generation of firmware from the creators of Grbl_ESP32. It includes a web based UI and the flexibility to operate a wide variety of machine types. This includes the ability to control machines with multiple tool types such as laser plus spindle or a tool changer.  

## Note about this Async fork/branch

This is an implementation of the WebUI using AsyncWebServer and AsyncWebSocket from https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer.git
It is still a very early work and not much has been tested so far in real world usage, so use it or try it at your own risks.
It was tested with both webui3 and webui2 and so far all basic functionality seems to work, as well as settings, configurations and OTA update.

The goal behind implementing async was to fix the issue where if any TCP client die without sending a gracefull disconnection during a job operation (think about a computer going into standby, a network cable unplugged from a switch / computer, etc.), and if using auto reports (which uses websockets), this will hang the job for some time. Based on preliminary testings, this new async mplementation does seem more rebust to these types of disconnections.

## Firmware Architecture

- Object-Oriented hierarchical design
- Hardware abstraction for machine features like spindles, motors, and stepper drivers
- Extensible - Adding new features is much easier for the firmware as well as gcode senders.

## Machine Definition Method

There is no need to compile the firmware. You use an installation script to upload the latest release of the firmware and then create [config file](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/config/overview) text file that describes your machine.  That file is uploaded to the FLASH on the ESP32 using the USB/Serial port or WIFI.

You can have multiple config files stored on the ESP32. The default is config.yaml, but you can change that with [**$Config/Filename=<myOtherConfig.yaml>**](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/features/commands_and_settings#config_filename)

## Basic Grbl Compatibility

The intent is to maintain as much Grbl compatibility as possible. It is 100% compatible with the day to day operations of running gcode with a sender, so there is no change to the Grbl gcode send/response protocol, and all Grbl gcode are supported. Most of the $ settings have been replaced with easily readable items in the config file.


## WebUI

FluidNC includes a built-in browser-based Web UI (Esp32_WebUI) so you control the machine from a PC, phone, or tablet on the same Wifi network.

## Credits

The original [Grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) is an awesome project by Sungeon (Sonny) Jeon. I have known him for many years and he is always very helpful. I have used Grbl on many projects.

The Wifi and WebUI is based on [this project.](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI)
