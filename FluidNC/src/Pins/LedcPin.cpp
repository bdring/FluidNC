    Ledc.cpp

    This is a driver for the ESP32 LEDC controller that is similar
    to the Arduino HAL driver for LEDC.  It differs from the Arduino
    driver by being able to handle output pin inversion in hardware,
    and by having the ledcSetDuty function in IRAM so it is safe
    to call it from ISRs.
